/**
 * Default implementation of stock exchange listing, runtime market-status checks, and testing toggles.
 *
 * <p>The most important business logic in this class is the {@code is-open} calculation exposed through
 * {@link #getStockExchangeStatus(Long)}.
 * That calculation follows the feature specification in this order:
 *
 * <ol>
 *     <li>load the exchange and read its configured {@code timeZone}</li>
 *     <li>convert the current instant into exchange-local date and time</li>
 *     <li>determine whether the local date is a trading day</li>
 *     <li>determine whether the local time is in pre-market, regular market, or post-market</li>
 *     <li>apply the {@code isActive} testing override</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Example:
 * if the current UTC instant is {@code 2026-04-06T14:30:00Z} and the exchange timezone is
 * {@code America/New_York}, the exchange-local time is {@code 10:30}.
 * For an exchange with regular hours {@code 09:30-16:00}, this is inside the regular market session.
