# Card Service

Card Service manages bank debit cards linked to existing account numbers. The current implementation covers the foundation of the microservice: the persistence model, card-number generation rules, CVV handling, and the main card-creation flow.

Implemented features:

- unique card numbers for Visa, MasterCard, DinaCard, and AmEx
- Luhn check-digit generation and validation
- three-digit CVV generation with hashed storage only
- automatic expiration dates set to 5 years after creation
- card status and spending-limit persistence
- REST endpoints for automatic, personal, and business card creation
- manual card creation guarded by `verification-service` status checks
- business-card issuance for account owners and authorized persons
- unit tests for generation rules and defaults

For shared project setup, git hooks, and infrastructure details, see the [root README](../README.md).

## Current Scope

This module currently implements the business core, not the full API surface.

Implemented now:

- JPA entity and Liquibase schema for cards
- brand-aware card number generation
- Luhn checksum support
- CVV generation plus hashing
- card-creation orchestration
- REST endpoints for card creation flows
- account ownership checks against `account-service`
- verification checks against `verification-service`
- exception model for business validation failures

Planned later:

- block, unblock, and deactivate flows
- masked card responses for clients

## Business Model

Each card stores the following fields:

| Field | Meaning | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `cardNumber` | Generated card number including the final Luhn digit | `4111111111111111` |
| `cardType` | Product type, currently fixed to `DEBIT` | `DEBIT` |
| `cardName` | Human-readable product name derived from the brand | `Visa Debit` |
| `creationDate` | Business creation date | `2026-03-23` |
| `expirationDate` | Automatically set to `creationDate + 5 years` | `2031-03-23` |
| `accountNumber` | Linked bank account number | `265000000000001234` |
| `cvv` | Stored only as a hash | `$argon2id$v=19$...` |
| `cardLimit` | Spending limit with monetary precision | `5000.00` |
| `status` | Card lifecycle state | `ACTIVE` |

## Ownership Model

Card ownership is modeled with two separate identifiers:

- `clientId` stores the owner of the linked account
- `authorizedPersonId` stores the optional business-account person for whom the card was issued

This means the fields are interpreted as follows:

| Scenario | `clientId` | `authorizedPersonId` |
|---|---|---|
| Personal card | personal-account owner | `null` |
| Business card issued to the business owner | business-account owner | `null` |
| Business card issued to an authorized person | business-account owner | authorized person's ID |

Example:

- if a company owner requests a card for themselves, the card keeps the owner's `clientId` and `authorizedPersonId = null`
- if the same owner requests a card for a colleague as an authorized person, the card still keeps the owner's `clientId`, while `authorizedPersonId` points to that colleague

## Supported Brands

The service currently supports these issuer rules:

| Brand | Prefix rules | Length |
|---|---|---|
| Visa | starts with `4` | 16 |
| MasterCard | starts with `51-55` or `2221-2720` | 16 |
| DinaCard | starts with `9891` | 16 |
| AmEx | starts with `34` or `37` | 15 |

## Card Number Structure

The number-generation flow follows the standard issuer-prefix plus Luhn-check-digit model:

1. choose the brand-specific issuer prefix
2. generate random account-specific digits for the middle section
3. calculate the last digit using the Luhn algorithm
4. check whether the resulting number is already in use
5. retry until a unique number is produced or the retry limit is reached

Example Visa generation:

```text
Prefix:          4
Middle digits:   12345678901234
Payload:         412345678901234
Luhn digit:      9
Final number:    4123456789012349
```

Example AmEx generation:

```text
Prefix:          37
Middle digits:   123456789012
Payload:         37123456789012
Luhn digit:      3
Final number:    371234567890123
```

## CVV Handling

CVV handling follows a stricter security rule than ordinary metadata:

1. the service generates exactly three random digits
2. the plain value is available only once, right after creation
3. the database stores only the Argon2 hash
4. verification is done by hash matching, never by decrypting anything

Example:

```text
Generated plain CVV: 123
Stored CVV hash:     $argon2id$v=19$...
```

## Card Creation Flow

When a new card is created, the service does the following:

1. validates that the account number is not blank
2. validates that the limit is not negative
3. generates a unique brand-compliant card number
4. generates a random three-digit CVV
5. hashes the CVV before persistence
6. sets `cardType` to `DEBIT`
7. derives `cardName`, for example `MasterCard Debit`
8. sets `creationDate` to the current date
9. sets `expirationDate` to five years after `creationDate`
10. sets `status` to `ACTIVE`
11. saves the entity and returns the one-time plain CVV to the caller

Example creation result:

```text
Persisted card:
  cardNumber:     378282246310005
  cardType:       DEBIT
  cardName:       AmEx Debit
  creationDate:   2026-03-23
  expirationDate: 2031-03-23
  accountNumber:  265000000000001234
  cvv:            $argon2id$v=19$...
  cardLimit:      12000.00
  status:         ACTIVE

One-time return value:
  plainCvv:       123
```

## Manual Request Flow

Manual card creation is now a single-step flow for both personal and business accounts.

The caller must first complete the external verification flow in `verification-service`.
`card-service` then receives the final request together with `verificationId` and calls:

```text
GET /{verificationId}/status
```

Only verification sessions with status `VERIFIED` are accepted. Any other status causes a business error response.

### Personal Card Request

Endpoint:

```text
POST /request
```

Example request:

```json
{
  "accountNumber": "265000000000123456",
  "cardBrand": "VISA",
  "cardLimit": 1500.00,
  "verificationId": 77
}
```

Behavior:

1. validate the request payload
2. verify that the authenticated client owns the account
3. reject business accounts on this endpoint
4. require `verification-service` status `VERIFIED`
5. enforce the personal rule: at most 2 active cards per account for the owner
6. create the card and send the success notification after commit

### Business Card Request

Endpoint:

```text
POST /request/business
```

Owner example:

```json
{
  "accountNumber": "265000000000999999",
  "recipientType": "OWNER",
  "cardBrand": "DINACARD",
  "cardLimit": 2500.00,
  "verificationId": 88
}
```

Authorized person example:

```json
{
  "accountNumber": "265000000000999999",
  "recipientType": "AUTHORIZED_PERSON",
  "cardBrand": "MASTERCARD",
  "cardLimit": 800.00,
  "verificationId": 99,
  "authorizedPerson": {
    "firstName": "Ana",
    "lastName": "Anic",
    "dateOfBirth": "1994-02-10",
    "gender": "FEMALE",
    "email": "ana@example.com",
    "phone": "0601234567",
    "address": "Adresa 1"
  }
}
```

Behavior:

1. validate the request payload and recipient type
2. verify that the authenticated client owns a business account
3. require `verification-service` status `VERIFIED`
4. resolve an existing authorized person when identity matches or create one from the inline payload
5. enforce the business rule: at most 1 active card per person on the same account
6. create the card and notify the owner, plus the authorized person when applicable

## Running Locally

### Hybrid mode

Start only the local dependencies in Docker:

```bash
cd card-service
docker compose up -d postgres_card rabbitmq
```

Then run `CardServiceApplication` from IntelliJ or with Gradle.

### Full stack

```bash
docker compose -f setup/docker-compose.yml up -d --build card-service
```

The service is exposed directly on `http://localhost:8087` and through the API gateway on `http://localhost/api/cards/`.

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `setup/` or in `card-service/` with values such as:

| Variable | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| `CARD_SERVER_PORT` | Port used by the service | `8087` |
| `CARD_DB_HOST` | Card database host | `postgres_card` |
| `CARD_DB_PORT` | Card database port | `5439` |
| `CARD_DB_NAME` | Card database name | `card_db` |
| `CARD_DB_USER` | Card database username | `postgres` |
| `CARD_DB_PASSWORD` | Card database password | `postgres` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Shared HMAC JWT secret | `my_secret_key` |
| `RABBITMQ_HOST` | RabbitMQ host | `rabbitmq` |
| `RABBITMQ_PORT` | RabbitMQ port | `5672` |
| `RABBITMQ_USERNAME` | RabbitMQ username | `rabbit` |
| `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD` | RabbitMQ password | `rabbit` |
| `NOTIFICATION_EXCHANGE` | Notification exchange name | `employee.events` |

## Persistence Notes

The service uses:

- PostgreSQL for production persistence
- Liquibase for schema changes
- Hibernate in `validate` mode only

That means table creation must happen through Liquibase migrations, not through automatic Hibernate DDL generation.

## Tests

Run the module tests with:

```bash
./gradlew :card-service:test
```

The JaCoCo HTML report is generated in `card-service/build/reports/jacoco/test/html/index.html`.

## Card Notification Flow

Card lifecycle changes publish RabbitMQ events consumed by `notification-service`.

Current flow:

1. `blockCard`, `unblockCard`, or `deactivateCard` persists the new status
2. `card-service` resolves the notification recipient from `client-service`
3. `card-service` builds a `CardNotificationDto` payload
4. the event is published only in `afterCommit`, so rollback does not produce a false email
5. `notification-service` consumes routing keys `card.blocked`, `card.unblocked`, and `card.deactivated`

Payload notes:

- `username` is the client display name returned by `client-service`
- `userEmail` is the recipient email returned by `client-service`
- `templateVariables.cardNumber` contains a masked card number
- `templateVariables.accountNumber` contains a masked account number
- `templateVariables.cardName` contains the card display name or fallback `kartica`
